# Synthetic-Data-Generation
## The Issue

The need to create synthetic testing data on the basis of the already existing data provided to enhance the performance of Brembo's AI model.

## Most Optimal Solution

I used OpenAI libraries and generate synthetic data via prompt engineering techniques by developing a AI model which is trained on the provided data that suplements the existing testing dataset.
